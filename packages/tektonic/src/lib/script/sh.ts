/**
 * POSIX `sh` scripting language plugin (the portable default for Alpine/BusyBox
 * and Wolfi images that ship `/bin/sh` but not bash).
 *
 * The preamble provides a `log` helper. When {@link ScriptCtx.captureExitCode}
 * is set, the user body runs inside a subshell `( … )` so a mid-script `exit N`
 * is contained. The contract file keeps the *worst* exit code seen across a
 * task's steps (so a later success cannot mask an earlier failure); the step
 * then re-exits with its own code. All constructs are POSIX-clean, so
 * {@link Bash} reuses this implementation verbatim with a bash shebang.
