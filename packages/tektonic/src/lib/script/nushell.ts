/**
 * Nushell scripting language plugin.
 *
 * The preamble provides the `log` helper previously copy-pasted as `nuHeader`
 * in consumers. Nushell's `exit` terminates the process immediately and cannot
 * be trapped, so the captured-exit contract runs the body inside `def main []`
 * wrapped in `try/catch`: clean completion yields `0`, a raised nushell error
 * yields `1`. Bodies should still signal failure by raising (`error make`) or
 * by letting an external command fail, since that is what produces a readable
 * message — but `exit` is no longer a trap: the reporter also reads Tekton's
 * own per-step exit code, which is recorded by the entrypoint and so survives a
 * body that terminates before this wrapper runs. The contract file keeps the
 * *worst* code seen across a task's steps (a later success cannot mask an
 * earlier failure); the step re-exits its own.

   * Fails synthesis on a non-zero `exit` in a capturing body.
   *
   * nushell's `exit` cannot be trapped, so the process dies before the wrapper
   * below persists anything: the contract file keeps its seeded `0`, and the
   * failure survives only because the reporter also reads Tekton's per-step
   * exit code — with no `error [task/step]` line to say what failed. This was a
   * silent-green bug in a consumer's own drift check for months, which is why a
   * warning is not enough for it. `error make {msg: "..."}` keeps both the
   * failure and its message.
   *
   * `exit 0` is exempt: an early return from a body with nothing to do is a
   * legitimate and common shape, and it cannot hide a failure. A body that
   * genuinely must exit non-zero opts out with {@link unsafeAllowExit}.
